# dobble-generator
Dobble (in US 'spot it!'), is a game in which players have to find symbols in common between two cards. 
Behind the amusing game hides beautiful math structure.

This project aim is to create a possible set of cards, which obey this math concept.

To simplify the ability to understand the outcome print, I changed the pictures into numbers.

You're more than welcome to change back the numbers into pictures (i've got some fruits but any pictures/symbols will work)

Want to try?

'''bash
git clone https://github.com/yuvaltoker/dobble-generator.git

cd dobble-generator

python3 make-grid.py
'''

Enjoy :)
