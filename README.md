# dobble-generator
Dobble (in US 'spot it!'), is a game in which players have to find symbols in common between two cards. 
Behind the amusing game hides beautiful math structure.

This project aim is to create a possible set of cards, which obey this math concept.

To simplify the ability to understand the outcome print, I changed the pictures into numbers.

Enjoy :)
